This version of mk_arcade_joystick_rpi is intended for use with the Freeplay Zero and Freeplay CM3 DIY kits that allow you to build a Raspberry Pi Zero or Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 into a handheld portable unit often used for retro gaming.

## Installation

### Installation Script

The install.sh included with this repository should build and install the driver.  Prior to running this script, you will likely want to install/update your kernel and kernel headers, just to be sure that they are current.

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y --force-yes raspberrypi-kernel raspberrypi-kernel-headers
sudo shutdown -h now
#After turning back on and moving to directory containing install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Driver Options

Please see install.sh (or /etc/modprobe.d/mk_arcade_joystick.conf) for examples.

This command will list the available parameters.
```
modinfo mk_arcade_joystick_rpi
```

### Testing/Calibrating

#### These are only recommended for troubleshooting, we have a utility that automates this [HERE](#mk_joystick_config)

Use the following commands to test (or dump) joysticks inputs :
```sh
jstest /dev/input/js0 #displays scaled values after min/max applications
jscal -c /dev/input/js0
evtest #displays raw values as they come in from the I2C chip
evdev-joystick --showcal /dev/input/event0
```

Joystick min, max, fuzz, flat can be set in /etc/modprobe.d/mk_arcade_joystick.conf or you can use variations of the following commands to configure joysticks inputs on the fly:
```sh
# The minimum and maximum values can be taken from the values evdev outputs
evdev-joystick --evdev /dev/input/event0 --axis 0 --minimum 374 --maximum 3418 --deadzone 384 --fuzz 16
evdev-joystick --evdev /dev/input/event0 --axis 1 --minimum 517 --maximum 3378 --deadzone 384 --fuzz 16
```
An additional tool, evTestValues.sh, is included to help find minimum and maximums. This does not account for axis inversion, so you will need to determine that yourself.

## Revisions
UPDATE 0.1.6.1 : Added support for Force Feedback via GPIO and/or PWM(PCA9633), see "Optional Flags" for information, note: can not be compares to a real controller due to hardware limitations, to be consider as experimental.

UPDATE 0.1.6.0 : Full integration of analog config builder, new make target (`config`) and `evTestValues.sh` as an `evtest` utility.

UPDATE 0.1.5.13 : Added ADS1015 I2C support, updated way to handle analog values, implementation the mk_joystick_config program to allow end users to easily create new configuration files.

UPDATE 0.1.5.12 : Added support for auto center detection, New I2C device handling (to skip devices if i2c is busy), Bug fixes
                  
UPDATE 0.1.5.11 : Fixed support for analog parameters (min, max, fuzz, flat)

UPDATE 0.1.5.10 : Added support for analog parameters (min, max, fuzz, flat)

UPDATE 0.1.5.9 : Added support for 4 extra GPIO inputs

UPDATE 0.1.5.8 : Added some new parameters to allow inverting of analog inputs

UPDATE 0.1.5.7 : Added MCP3021 i2c support for up to 4 analog inputs

UPDATE 0.1.5.6 : Added 4 buttons, the ability to use GPIO32 and higher, and hkmode parameter

UPDATE 0.1.5.5 : Modified for use with Freeplay Zero/CM3

UPDATE 0.1.5 : Added GPIO customization

UPDATE 0.1.4 : Compatibily with rpi2 

UPDATE 0.1.3 : Compatibily with 3.18.3 :

The driver installation now works with 3.18.3 kernel, distributed with the last firmware.

UPDATE 0.1.2 : Downgrade to 3.12.28+ :

As the module will not load with recent kernel and headers, we add the possibility of downgrading your firmware to a compatible version, until we find a fix.

UPDATE 0.1.1 : RPi B+ VERSION :

The new Raspberry Pi B+ Revision brought us 9 more GPIOs, so we are now able to connect 2 joysticks and 12 buttons directly to GPIOs. I updated the driver in order to support the 2 joysticks on GPIO configuration.

# mk_joystick_config

This utility makes creation of a new keymap easier, accounting for analog and GPIO inputs. Detects available I2C chips, min/max values of the axis, and if the axis is reversed. After a new config file has been created, the user will need to rebind the controls for emulationstation. To make sure this is done, we backup your old config and remove the original, which is found in `/opt/retropie/configs/all/emulationstation/es_input.cfg.bak` should you need it. The new one can be found in the same directory without the `.bak` extension.

##### NOTE: Some users don't use the Power Slider as Hotkey, instead opting to use Select. You still need to map the Power Slider in mk_joystick_config for correct binding behavior.

## Usage
- `make config` (recommended, runs mk_joystick_config with recommended settings and backs up your old emulationstation bindings, shuts down after use. You will be prompted to rebind keys in emulationstation on next system startup)
- `./mk_joystick_config [-debug] [-maxnoise [60]] [-adcselect]` 
  - (If you need to debug or change the noise value)

### Optional Flags
- `-debug`, enable debug messages, Recommended: off (Optional)
- `-adcselect`, force user to select ADC chip type, default:off (Optional)
- `-maxnoise`, maximum noise allowed for ADC chip, values under 60 can cause issues, Recommended:60 (Optional)

##### NOTE: Press analogs to their extremes softly, rotating slowly once or twice. Pushing too hard or rotating them too many times will make binding hard/impossible. If you do this by accident, you can reduce each value in the config with the same value decreased/increased by ~5% for the larger/smaller values, respectively.

## Changelog
- 0.1c : Bugfix
- 0.1b : Autodetection of ADC type fully implemented
- 0.1a : Initial testing release
